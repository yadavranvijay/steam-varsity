    <h2>What is Design Thinking?</h2>


    <p>Design Thinking is an innovative problem-solving process rooted in a set of skills. It's a human-centered approach that begins with understanding the needs of the people you're designing for and ends with new solutions that are tailor-made to suit their needs. Design Thinking is about believing we can make a difference and having an intentional process to get to new, relevant solutions that create positive impact.
    </p>
<p>
    Design Thinking revolves around a deep interest in developing an understanding of the people for whom we're designing the products or services. It helps us observe and develop empathy with the target user. Design Thinking helps us in the process of questioning: questioning the problem, questioning the assumptions, and implications. It's extremely useful in tackling problems that are ill-defined or unknown, by re-framing the problem in human-centric ways, creating many ideas in brainstorming sessions, and adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping and testing.</p>
