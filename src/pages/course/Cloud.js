                    The course begins with an overview of cloud computing, discussing its importance, components, and the major providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. You'll learn about the various service models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), and how they can be used to scale and enhance web applications. </p>
<p>
                    You'll then delve into web development, starting with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As the course progresses, you'll explore server-side programming, databases, and how to integrate these with cloud services. You'll learn about deploying websites, managing domains, and ensuring security and scalability.
                    </p><p>
                    Throughout the course, you'll work on practical projects that challenge you to use cloud services to build and deploy web applications. You'll gain hands-on experience with cloud storage, databases, and computing resources, learning how to choose and implement the right services for your needs.
