            <p>
              Problem-based learning (PBL) is a teaching methodology that
              focuses on promoting student-centered learning. In this approach,
              students work collaboratively in groups to tackle an open-ended
              problem. The problem is designed to be challenging and complex,
              which helps to stimulate critical thinking skills and encourages
              students to explore different solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              At STEAM Varsity, PBL differs from traditional teaching methods in
              that it places the onus on students to lead their learning. .
              Rather than being fed information by a teacher, students are
              encouraged to ask questions, investigate and research the problem,
              and come up with their own solutions. This approach helps to
              foster a sense of curiosity and autonomy among students.

            <h2>What Is The Role Of Students In Problem Based Learning?</h2>
            <p>
              Students play an active role in their learning process. They work
              collaboratively in groups to identify and solve complex problems.
              This approach encourages students to take responsibility for their
              learning, think critically, and communicate effectively with their
              peers. Students are also responsible for reflecting on their
              learning and evaluating their progress. The teacher is a
              facilitator, providing guidance and support as needed, but
              students are ultimately responsible for their learning.

            <h2>What Is The Role Of Teacherâ€™s In Problem Based Learning?</h2>
            <p>
              The teacher's role in PBL is to guide and support the students,
              but the students are ultimately responsible for their learning
              process. The teacher encourages the students to take ownership of
              their learning by setting goals and reflecting on their progress.
              The teacher also helps the students develop the critical thinking
              and problem-solving skills they need to succeed in the real world.
            </p>
            <p>
              One important aspect of the teacher's role in PBL is to ensure
              that the problem is aligned with the course's learning objectives.
              The teacher works with the students to identify the key concepts
              and skills they need to master and then designs a problem that
              will challenge them to apply them meaningfully. This helps to
              ensure that the students are learning important content and
              developing the skills they need to succeed in their future
              careers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The teacher's role in PBL is to facilitate active and
              collaborative learning, help students develop critical thinking
              and problem-solving skills, and ensure that the course's learning
              objectives are met. By taking on this role, the teacher can help
              students to become engaged, motivated, and successful learners who
              are well-prepared for the challenges of the real world.
