              At STEAM Varsity, we strongly believe that active learning is
              essential for effective education. We are convinced that hands-on
              experiences are indispensable for turning theoretical knowledge
              into practical skills. Rather than solely relying on lectures and
              textbooks, we emphasize the importance of gaining experiential
              knowledge by engaging in real-world activities.
            </p>

            <p>
              By providing opportunities for students to work on tangible
              projects, we aim to create a dynamic and practical learning
              environment. Through these experiences, students can develop
              critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills.
              Furthermore, they gain a deeper understanding of the subject
              matter and are better prepared for their future careers.
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe that our approach to education not only benefits our
              students but society as a whole. By fostering a culture of active
              learning and practical application, we hope to produce competent
              and innovative professionals who can contribute to the betterment
              of our world.

              <strong>Experiential Learning </strong>
              is an active methodology that involves experiencing concepts
              through actions. This approach encourages students to learn from
              their mistakes and draw valuable conclusions, fostering a culture
              of continuous improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main objective of learning by doing is to prevent students
              from forgetting the knowledge they acquire over time. This is
              achieved by actively engaging with the concepts instead of
              passively memorizing them. As a result, students not only learn
              new knowledge but also develop practical skills that they can
              apply to other situations or share with their colleagues.

                  <strong> Active engagement: </strong> Learning by doing
                  involves actively engaging with the material or task at hand,
                  which can help to increase motivation and interest in the
                  subject.

              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong> Improved retention: </strong> When we learn by doing,
                  we are more likely to remember what we have learned because
                  the experience is more memorable.

              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong> Enhanced problem-solving skills: </strong> Learning
                  by doing can help us develop better problem-solving skills
                  because we are required to think critically and creatively in
                  order to complete the task at hand.

                  challenges, which can be especially valuable in fields such as
                  science, engineering, and medicine, where practical experience
                  is essential.

            <h2>When does learning by doing work?</h2>
            <p>
            Learning by doing, also known as <strong>experiential learning</strong>, is a pedagogical approach that emphasizes active, hands-on experiences to  facilitate learning. Students are encouraged to immerse themselves in real-world situations and engage in problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making processes that help them understand and apply complex concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
            This approach is particularly effective in fields such as science, engineering, technology, and the arts, where practical skills are essential. Students learn by performing experiments, building models, designing prototypes, or creating artwork, among other activities. By doing so, they gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and develop a range of skills that are necessary for success in these fields.
            </p>
            <p>
            Learning by doing also encourages students to learn from their mistakes and draw conclusions after analyzing their experiences. This helps them develop a clear spirit of continuous improvement and a willingness to take risks and try new things. By focusing on the process of learning rather than just the end result, students are more likely to retain what they have learned and apply it in new situations.
            </p>
            <p>
            learning by doing can be a powerful way to engage learners and make education more enjoyable and memorable. It provides students with the opportunity to take an active role in their learning and develop a range of skills that are essential for success in the 21st century.
